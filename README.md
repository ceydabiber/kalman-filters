# Advanced Kalman Filtering and Sensor Fusion

This folder contains my work from the "Advanced Kalman Filtering and Sensor Fusion" Udemy course. It includes coding practices, a capstone project, and videos demonstrating my experiments with different Kalman Filters.

## Files:
- **Linear Kalman Filter**: Basic implementation of the Linear Kalman Filter.
- **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**: A standard implementation of the UKF.
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**: Implementation of the EKF for non-linear systems.
- **Improved UKF**: An enhanced version of the UKF, demonstrating my ability to optimize filtering performance.

## Videos:
- **Baseline UKF Performance**: A video showcasing the initial performance of the UKF model.
- **Improved UKF Filtering**: A video demonstrating the enhanced performance after optimization.

Feel free to explore the code and videos to better understand the differences between the filters and the improvements I implemented!
